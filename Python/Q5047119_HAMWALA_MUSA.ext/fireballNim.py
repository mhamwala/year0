1.Players alternate turns and each player must move the fireball at least one space. 
2.The first player may move the fireball orthogonally straight down the board as far as desired,
up to the edge of the board, remaining in the same column of squares. The fireball must move at least one square. 
3.The second player must move the ball orthogonally rightwards as many squares as desired, up to the edge of the board.
Again, the fireball must remain on the same row during the second playerâ€™s rightwards move and move at least one space. 
4.Players alternate moving the fireball in this manner until it is moved onto the pit space. When the fireball is moved
on to the pit space, the game is over.  The player who moved the fireball on to the pit space is declared the winner! 
5.Players may only move the fireball horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally).
